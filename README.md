# My neovim dot

I have use vim for two years but I still not known it. 

If you like my dot, you can use it 

## About the dot

Now I use lua, because lua is better to create mod

### Cocnvim

I use Cocnvim. So make sure you have install node.js and It should not be very old. Or put the node manully to your path of the shell

I use such plugins:

* coc-pylint
    * This plugin always report useless error when use opencv. So I mannuly stop it
* Flutter
    * This has nothing about plugin. I mannuly install flutter to my path. So you'd better put flutter and dart into your path. I do not use coc-flutter because one day it cannot autocomplete. So I manully set the lsp

### Key

I set two key: ff and M-F. M-F may more like which emacsman use. xD.

### coc-setting.json

Change the file path to Yours

### Function.vim

I set the tab for different files. At first I use four tab. But dart, clang-foramt ,json, javascript use two. so, I set this for these, when change to different files
